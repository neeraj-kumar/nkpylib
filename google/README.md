# nkpylib Google backups interfaces

These utils offer access to certain elements of google backups.

## Google Timeline
This actually is not from the takeout, but rather exported from the phone directly:
On your phone, go to Settings -> Location -> Location Services -> Timeline -> Export Timeline. This
is not identical to takeout, but this export also contains a json file with your entire location
history, which can be visualized using online tools like Dawarich (not my website, use at own risk).
